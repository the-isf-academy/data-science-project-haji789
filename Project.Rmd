# Data

```{python}
#Include any import statements you will need
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('social_media_use_clean.csv')
```

**What is this data about?**


Your answer here: 


**Where is this data from?**


Your answer here: 
Include who created this data set. 
Be sure to explain how this data was collected, who this data was collected from, when this data was collected, and where this data was collected.


# Subquestions


**What quantitative subquestions will you investigate?** 


List at least 3 questions that you could answer given the maths and data science tools you know.

# Methods and Results

```{python}
#Import any helper files you need here
```

## Which block(A Block, B Block, C Block, etc.) in our school uses the most energy on extra energy consumers?


### Methods


**How will you approach this question? What data science tools/functions will you use, and why?**


I will approach this question by comparing the five buildings/blocks with the amount of energy that is used for each one on their extra energy consumers. A bar graph will be used to represent the data, as I believe that it is the graph type that is most capable of clearly showing the differences in the values that each building/block uses.


**Which data will you use, and how will you reorganize / store this data?**
