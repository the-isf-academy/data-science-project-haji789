# Introduction

## Overarching Question: How much of our school’s energy is used on extra energy consumers(mainly explore air conditioners, heaters, lights)?



**Why this question?** 


[EDIT ME]


# Data

```{python}
#Include any import statements you will need
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{python}
df1 = pd.read_csv('ISF HVAC Hourly Data.csv')
df2 = pd.read_csv('ISF Lighting Hourly Data.csv')
df3 = pd.read_csv('table33_1_.csv')
```

```{python}
df1.describe()
```

```{python}
df2.describe()
```

```{python}
df3.describe()
```

**What is this data about?**


In general, the data that I have chosen mainly explains the amount of energy in kilowatts that are used on multiple systems of both our school and other schools around Hong Kong over different amounts of time. The columns that I would like to work with for the google sheets data set would be the rows that included all of the buildings of the school campus, as some rows of A and C block were not available yet due to the building not being built yet. On the other hand, I would like to monitor the HVAC and lighting systems through the GHUB website, as I believe that this will help me answer my overarching question. Finally, the columns that I would like to use from the government data set would be the HVAC and lighting statistics for the schools around Hong Kong.


**Where is this data from?**


The ISF Environment Data Set was created by our school’s Shuyuan Sustainability Team, being collected through sensors that are placed all around our school to track the amount of energy that is used in heaters, air conditioners and lights in each of the buildings in our school, the data was then programmed to run through some code that would place the data that was collected into a google sheets document, having data being collected from August 1st 2018 till July 31st 2019. There is also a website called GHUB that allows our teachers to monitor the amount of kilowatts that are used in the HVAC and lighting systems of our school, being able to be accessed at any time any where(as long as the user has an internet connection). Finally, I will also be using a dataset that was made by the government that educates viewers about the amount of energy that is used on the energy systems across Hong Kong schools, giving me a good comparison.


# Subquestions


**What quantitative subquestions will you investigate?** 


1. Which block(A Block, B Block, C Block, etc.) in our school uses the most energy on extra energy consumers?

2. What are the most common solutions that are used by our school to decrease the use of energy?

3. Which extra energy consumer( air conditioners, heaters, lights) uses the most energy in our school?

4. What are the differences in energy use in primary(G, YG) and secondary blocks(A, B) from extra energy consumers?


# Methods and Results

```{python}
#Import any helper files you need here
```

## Which block(A Block, B Block, C Block, etc.) in our school uses the most energy on extra energy consumers?


### Methods


**How will you approach this question? What data science tools/functions will you use, and why?**

I will approach this question by comparing the five buildings/blocks with the amount of energy that is used for each one on their extra energy consumers. Code used in past classes will be used ot find the average amount of energy used in each block, which will then be displayed in a bar graph by using code that had been written by us in the past.


**Which data will you use, and how will you reorganize / store this data?**

I will be using the ISF environment data sets as it shows the amount of energy that are used on lighting and HVAC across all five of the buildings(Blocks from both the Primary and also Secondary sections of our school). I will then take the processed data(using "Average Amount" code) that I have found from the dataset and express it through a bar graph, different labels will be used to show the differences between each building.

plt.bar(y_pos, performance, align='center', alpha=0.5)
plt.xticks(y_pos, objects)
plt.ylabel('Energy Produced(Kilowatts per hour)')
plt.title('Which Block in Our School Uses the Most Energy on Extra Energy Consumers?')

plt.show()
```

## Which extra energy consumer( air conditioners, heaters, lights) uses the most energy in our school?


### Methods


**How will you approach this question? What data science tools/functions will you use, and why?**

I will approach this question by comparing the total amount of energy used on the lighting of our school compared to the HVAC(Heaters and air conditioners). The "Average Amount" code that was written in past classes will be used to figure out the average use of energy for each system, the data will then be shown as it is through using the code above, it will also be labeled to show differences.


**Which data will you use, and how will you reorganize / store this data?**

I will be using ISF enviroment datasets as I will be able to find the amount of energy that are used un the lighting and the HVAC systems all across the school. I will then use the average code to display everything(note that everything will be labeled, as I believe that by doing this it will allow the people who will be looking at my results to understand what I am trying to communicate.

## What are the differences between schools energy use on extra energy consumers when compared to the government statistics on Hong Kong’s educational systems?



### Methods


**How will you approach this question? What data science tools/functions will you use, and why?**

I will approach this question by comparing the amount of energy that is used on our school when compared to the data that is given to us by the government on how much energy Hong Kong's educational system uses on average. The "Average Amount" code that was written in past classes will be used to figure out the average use of energy for each system, the data will then be shown as it is through using the code above, it will also be labeled to show differences.


**Which data will you use, and how will you reorganize / store this data?**

I will be using ISF enviroment datasets and the government statistics dataset, as I will be able to use the data from both datasets to look at the amount of energy on lighting and HVAC across our school and also Hong Kong educational systems.. I will then use the average amount code to process all of the data which will then be labeled to show the differences, as I believe that by doing this it will allow the people who will be looking at my results to understand what I am trying to tell them.

## What are the differences in energy use in primary(G, YG) and secondary blocks(A, B) from extra energy consumers?


### Methods


**How will you approach this question? What data science tools/functions will you use, and why?**

I will approach this question by comparing the amount of energy that is used on in the primary blocks of G and YG with the energy use in the secondary block of A and B. Code used in past classes will be used ot find the average amount of energy used in each block, which will then be displayed in a bar graph by using code that had been written by us in the past.


**Which data will you use, and how will you reorganize / store this data?**

I will then take the data that I have found from the datasets and express it through finding average code between all of the data. Afterwards, I will take the values and finally place it into a bar graph, so that my audience can understand what I am trying to communicate.
