On the other hand, I would like to monitor the HVAC and lighting systems through the GHUB website, as I believe that this will help me answer my overarching question. Finally, the columns that I would like to use from the government data set would be the HVAC and lighting statistics for the schools around Hong Kong."

There is also a website called GHUB that allows our teachers to monitor the amount of kilowatts that are used in the HVAC and lighting systems of our school, being able to be accessed at any time any where(as long as the user has an internet connection). Finally, I will also be using a dataset that was made by the government that educates viewers about the amount of energy that is used on the energy systems across Hong Kong schools, giving me a good comparison."

    "Sub-question 1:\n",
    "What suprised me the most was that YG block seemed to have a pretty significant difference when compared to the other blocks, as the primary students still seem to use the classrooms and facilities on a daily basis. Furthermore, the classrooms used in YG and G block are pretty simmilar when it comes to energy use and also quantity. However, the fact that C block used around 90 kilowatts of energy per hour does make sense, as most of the facilities in the building seem to use more energy, as the facilities would include the heating of the swimming pools, the bright lights in both the auditorium, gym area, squash courts etc.. By looking at the results, I can see that our school does seem to be a pretty \"green school\" as an article written by Marianne Bray from SCMP has said, having low stats such as the average of around 19.4 kilowatts used per hour. Even though C Block does use a high amount, the school has no control over this as some of the things inside the building can't be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-question 2:\n",
    "What suprised me a lot was that the difference of energy used in the HVAC and lighting systems were so different, as I would think that the months where the temperatures might start to cool down, might of had been a phase where students and teachers would not need a heater or the air conditioning. However the lighting systems having such a low value made sense, as lights don't really need that much power to operate in the first place. By looking at the results we can tell that our school is pretty eco friendly, as an article written by Marianne Bray from SCMP seems to agree with us, I believe that the reason why it might be like this is due to knowing that our school does use solar energy, which might make a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-question 3:\n",
    "What suprised me a lot was that the difference of kilowatts per hour were so big when compared between the average school in Hong Kong and our school, even though our school does promote saving energy when on campus, I didn't think that it would have such a big impact to lower its rates by that much when compared to other schools around Hong Kong. By looking at the results we can tell that our school is more eco friendly when compared to other schools, as there seems to be a 22 kilowatt per hour gap inbetween the two averages, this might be like this as our school uses solar energy and also encourages students and teachers to due specific things to be more \"green\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-question 4:\n",
    "What suprised me a lot was that the primary blocks seemed to use less energy than the secondary blocks, as the students in secondary are always encouraged to save energy, by being given lecture to, enrolled in energy saving competitions etc.. However the facilities that the primary blocks have are smaller in size when compared to the secondary blocks, due to this happening it makes sense that they use less energy. Furthermore, primary students due tend to use some parts of the secondary block, which means that they play a role in using the energy in our buildings. By looking at the results we can tell that our school might not be that eco friendly in the secondary blocks, as there seems to be a slight gap between the two averages. I think that this might be because of how our primary blocks use solar energy. Furthermore, the facilities used in our secondary blocks might use more energy when compared to the primary blocks."

Another limitation would be data set 3, as we are not sure which school they chose to collect data from, as some schools might not be a normal primary/secondary school like ours, they could possiblt specialize in teaching something that uses a lot of energy throughout the entire year."
