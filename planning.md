# Data Science Project Planning

## Question + Data
Write your question and any initial thoughts or ideas you have about it.

What parts of the social media data will you use to answer the question?

Answers to this question can be found in the Project.md jupyter notebook. 

## Analysis strategy
In this section, outline the functions you think you will need for your data analysis. Consider:
  * what statistics will be most interesting?
  * Will you need to sort/regroup/transform your data?
  * What plots will you want to display your data?

Answers to this question can be found in the Project.md jupyter notebook. 

## Sharing finding
In this section, discuss who you think will be interested in your findings and how you will share your findings with them. For example, a flyer? an Instagram post? a video?

I believe that the Shuyuan Sustainability Team will be interested in my findings, as most of the questions that I have created consists of aspects of the data that they have collected in the past, this is why I believe that the graphs will help them. I think that I will share this to them through sending them an email or providing them with a google slides presentation, so that I can explain to them my personal opinions towards the data that has been collected.

## Calendar + Milestones
  * **Class 1:** Question and background research completed
  * **Class 2:** Finish writing planning.md and start figuring out how the data for each subquestion should be represented.
  * **Class 3:** Start programming the graphs for the first two subquestions.
  * **Class 4:** Start programming the graphs for the last two subquestions. 
  * **Class 5:** Finish writing the sections(next steps, discussion, summary) that are within the discussion column.
